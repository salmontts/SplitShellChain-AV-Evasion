# SplitShellChain-AV-Evasion-Modular-Payloads

## üß† Executive Summary

**SplitShellChain** is a modular execution technique and PoC framework for bypassing Windows Defender and EDR detection ‚Äî *without obfuscation, encryption, or packing*.

By slicing malicious PowerShell payloads (such as reverse shells and keyloggers) into harmless-looking fragments, it defeats both static and heuristic AV signatures.  
The core of this method is **dot chaining**: every script fragment ends with `. .\nextfile.ps1`, so execution seamlessly flows through the chain, but escapes Defender's detection logic.

**This repo demonstrates:**
- Defender-blocked payloads (reverse shell, keylogger)
- The same logic, split and chained, *fully bypassing* AV/EDR
- Automation for splitting any PowerShell script

## üß¨ About the Technique ‚Äì SplitChain: Authored Logic Model Bypass

**SplitShellChain/SplitChain** is a novel, self-authored method of AV/EDR bypass.  
Unlike typical exploits or obfuscation, this approach attacks the logic model of security solutions itself.

### What is SplitChain?  
SplitChain is a method for de-integrating malicious payloads into many single-line files, executed sequentially via chaining (dot-source, `./`, pipe chaining, etc.).  
The source code is reconstructed only at runtime, escaping detection by anti-virus heuristics that rely on file integrity, entropy, and static signatures.

**This is not a known exploit, nor is it described in public research ‚Äì it‚Äôs an original attack on the architecture of static and behavioral AV/EDR engines.**  
It exposes a rare class of vulnerabilities: logic model bypasses, not traditional software bugs.

> _I have not found any public documentation of this method.  
> This project demonstrates a new bypass class: **AV logic model 0-day**._

### Why is this significant?
- Most researchers seek exploits. SplitChain redefines the execution paradigm itself.
- Most tools automate known shellcode or payload delivery. SplitChain changes the structure of execution flow.
- This is not about hiding code, but about changing the system‚Äôs ‚Äúthinking‚Äù ‚Äì shifting the attack surface to the AV‚Äôs blind spot: the file system and execution logic.

**This approach opens new perspectives for red teaming, AI-assisted offensive research, and security model evaluation.**

## üöÄ Live Demo: AV Bypass in Action

**Image 1: Defender blocks original reverse shell script immediately**  
![Defender blocks original script](invoke-powershelltcp/invokeps1tcp_1.png)

**Image 2: SplitShellChain payload executes reverse shell, no AV alert**  
![SplitShellChain payload runs, AV silent](invoke-powershelltcp/invokeps1tcp_2.png)

- Top left: Running `invoke-powershelltcp.ps1` ‚Äî Defender blocks execution as "malicious content."
- Bottom left: Entering `output\line001.ps1` (SplitShellChain) ‚Äî *no AV alert*.
- Right: Attacker's netcat session ‚Äî full shell access (whoami, ipconfig, etc.) with Defender enabled.
- OBS capture confirms real-time, real-world test.

## ‚úÖ How It Works

Antivirus/EDR engines often flag:
- Strings: `Invoke-Expression`, `System.Text.Encoding`, suspicious prompts, etc.
- Behavioral patterns: command chain, socket, keylogging, etc.

**SplitShellChain defeats these by:**
- Splitting payloads into many `.ps1` files, each one innocuous alone
- Breaking dangerous constructs (stream, execution, logging) into separate scripts
- Chaining via `. .\next.ps1` instead of `Start-Process` or `IEX`
- Optional: random comments, delays, cleanup, DuckyScript launcher

> **Dot Chaining**:  
> Each line of the execution chain ends with a dot-source invocation (`. .\nextfile.ps1`).  
> This keeps execution smooth and complete, but circumvents Defender's and EDR's logic, which expects malicious code in a single file or process.  
> The program runs as intended, yet every step is below the detection threshold.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

**Split any PowerShell payload:**
```sh
python shellsplitter.py -i keylogger.ps1 -o output --chain --runner --comments --delay 200
```
- Launch with `. .\line001.ps1`
- AV/EDR will not flag the execution chain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Function Splitting Required

Some payloads need you to **manually split key functions** as separate scripts before chaining, especially for complex logic:
- In the keylogger:  
  - `keywrite.ps1`, `keytranslate.ps1`, `keyloop.ps1` are split as standalone helper scripts.
- In the reverse TCP shell:  
  - `executor.ps1`, `receiver.ps1`, and `responder.ps1` are separated for modular chaining.
- This ensures critical logic is both reusable and split enough to evade detection.  
  If you only chain line-by-line, some AVs may still catch complex logic blocks.

- **Original scripts**: Detected and blocked by Defender/EDR ([Image 1](invoke-powershelltcp/invokeps1tcp_1.png))
- **SplitShellChain**: Chained execution bypasses Defender/EDR entirely ([Image 2](invoke-powershelltcp/invokeps1tcp_2.png)), granting full attacker control or silent keylogging

## üéØ Impact

SplitShellChain exposes a real-world, non-obfuscation AV/EDR bypass method:
- Bypasses Defender/EDR heuristics and static patterns
- Enables modular payload delivery (reverse shell, keylogger, persistence)
- Demonstrates the urgent need for better chained file execution detection

## üì¢ About the Research & Disclosure

This technique was submitted to Microsoft through their bug bounty program.  
**Microsoft responded that it does not qualify as a Defender bug** under their current criteria.  
However, we believe this is a significant blind spot in modern AV/EDR logic and encourage the security community to **research and test** this method further.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Important Notes

This project is intended strictly for **research, educational, and defensive purposes**.  
Do **not** use these techniques for unauthorized access or in production environments ‚Äî this may violate laws and platform policies.

Some payloads (especially those with complex logic, e.g., keyloggers or reverse shells) require **manual splitting** of functional components into separate scripts before using the chain generator.  
This is necessary to ensure that all critical logic is split into non-flagged fragments and each `.ps1` file remains simple enough to evade detection.
